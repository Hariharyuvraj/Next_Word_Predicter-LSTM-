# Next_Word_Predicter-LSTM
This project goal is to demonstrate how to use LSTM networks and apply in some real data.
By using some real time data we made the LSTM model.It can pridict the next 'word'



# Prerequisites:
The code was written in Python, and uses:

Pandas and Numpy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib (for data visualisation)
Keras (for building and training the model)

sklearn (for data scaling)

# Results:
A LSTM network is able to predict the next 'word' using the data.
